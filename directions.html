    <h1>Step by Step Directions to make Creamy Cajun Chicken Pasta</h1>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3> Don't forget to let the pan get really hot before you add butter and olive oil!</h3>
    
    <ol class="ordered_list">
    <li>Combine the ingredients for the Cajun seasoning in a small bowl. Cut the chicken into 1/2 to 3/4-inch cubes. Place the cubed chicken in a bowl, pour the Cajun seasoning over top, and stir to coat the chicken in spices.</li>
    <li>Add the olive oil and butter to a large deep skillet. Heat the oil and butter over medium-high until the skillet is <i>very hot</i> and the butter is melted and is foamy. Add the seasoned chicken to the skillet and cook for a couple minutes on each side, or just until the outside gets some color. The chicken does not need to be cooked through at this point.</li>
    <li>Add the diced yellow onion to the skillet and continue to saut√© for about 2 minutes more, or just until the onion begins to soften. Allow the moisture from the onion to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
    <li>Next, add the pasta, fire roasted diced tomatoes <i>(with the juices)</i> and chicken broth to the skillet. Stir just until everything is evenly combined, then place a lid on top and allow the broth to come up to a boil.</li>
    <li>Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and let the pasta simmer for about ten minutes, <i>stirring</i> every couple of minutes, until the pasta is tender and the liquid is thick and saucy.</li>
    <li>Add the cream cheese to the skillet in chunks, then stir until it has melted into the sauce. Top the pasta with sliced green onions and serve.</li>
